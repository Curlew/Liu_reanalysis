Liu_reanalysis
==============

This is my first attempt at a reanalysis of Liu et al's paper in Global Ecology and Biogeography, [which can be found here.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12113/abstract)

My main issues with it are:

* It fails to account for spatial autocorrelation
* It fails to account for potential differences between studies
* And most importantly the authors analyse variables associated with differences aboveground biomass (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and age of forest stand) seperately when they are likely to have additive and possibly interactive effects.

I want tot write a response to this paper some time soon, so if you have any comments please feel free to leave them and if you would like to co-author a response leave a comment here and I'll get back to you.
